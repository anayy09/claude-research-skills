# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the repository
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Individual
skills carry their own version in their `SKILL.md`; this log tracks the collection.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `research-ideation` skill — a research strategist that inventories the user's
  existing assets, generates candidate directions from a catalog of 23 ideation
  operators, verifies the novelty delta against real prior work, scores and ranks
  on six weighted dimensions with cap rules, and produces a per-direction path to
  submission (gap ledger, headline table, minimum evidence set, kill experiment,
  reviewer objections, and a backward schedule against the deadline).
- `submission-reviewer` skill — fair, constructive peer review of a paper or
  patent submission against a weighted rubric, with a score out of 100 and band,
  verified-only novelty checks against prior art, authenticity and internal
  consistency checks, cap rules for blocking flaws, partial scoring for
  incomplete submissions, and ranked fixes with a projected score.

### Changed
- Renamed the `humanizer` skill to `prose-naturalizer` (1.0.0 → 2.0.0). Breaking:
  the folder and skill name changed; update any local install of the old folder.

### Deprecated
- `deep-research` (2.9.3 → 2.10.0) is deprecated in favor of `evidence-synthesis`
  (formal reviews) and `investigating-sources` (citation-honest research). It
  still works during a transition period but will receive no further updates.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- `evidence-synthesis` skill — plan, run, appraise, and report systematic and
  other evidence syntheses (PRISMA-S search reporting, PRISMA 2020 flow, RoB tool
  selection, GRADE certainty, executable citation/retraction verification, and
  RAISE-compliant AI-use disclosure).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-25

First public release of the collection.

### Added
- Nine skills: `data-engineering`, `deep-research`, `experiment-ledger`,
  `hipergator-hpc`, `humanizer`, `investigating-sources`, `journal-advisor`,
  `ml-eval-statistics`, `research-paper-writing`.
- A README per skill, and a flagship README with an auto-generated skill catalog.
- `scripts/generate_catalog.py` to keep the catalog in sync with skill frontmatter.
- Contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy, issue/PR templates, and
  a CI workflow that validates every skill's structure and frontmatter.

### Changed
- Standardized every skill's frontmatter: added `summary`, semantic `version`,
  `author`, `license`, and a consistent `metadata` block.
